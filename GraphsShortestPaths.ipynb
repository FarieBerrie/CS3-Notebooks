    "- a typical problem is to find the total length of the shortest path between two specified vertices\n",
    "- see figure below, e.g.:\n",
    "    - $w = $ weight\n",

    "    1. create a set of all the **unvisited nodes**\n",
    "    2. assign every node a tentative distance value using array: $0$ for start vertex, $\\infty$ for all other nodes\n",
    "    3. for each node, consider all of its unvisited neighbors and calculate their tentative distances through the current node, update the distance with the smaller value\n",
    "        e.g., if the current node $A$ is marked with a distance of $6$ and the edge connecting it with a neighbor $B$ has length $2$, then the distance to $B$ through $A$ is $6+2=8$. If $B$'s current distance is greater than $8$, then update it to $8$\n",
    "    4. when done considering all the unvisited neighbors of the current node, mark the current node as visited and remove it from the **unvisited set**\n",
    "    5. select the next unvisited node that has the smallest tentative distance, and repeat from step 3\n",
    "    - at the end, array created in step 2 will contain the shortest distance values \n",
