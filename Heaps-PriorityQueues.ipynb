    "## Priority Queues\n",
    "- in real-life and in computing applications, we may have to choose the next \"most important\" from a collection of people, tasks, or objects\n",
    "    - doctors in a hospital emergency room often choose to see next \"most critical\" patient\n",
    "    - operating systems picks programs (jobs) with the highest priority\n",
    "- when collection of objects is organized by importance or priority, we call this a **priority queue**\n",
    "    - normal queue is not efficient as it takes $\\Theta(n)$ time to search for the next highest priority element\n",
    "\n",
    "## Priority Queue Applications\n",
    "- can be applied to solving graph problems such as single-source shortest paths (SSSP) and minimal-cost spanning tree (MST)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Representing Priority Queue\n",
    "- how should we effectively represent priority queue?\n",
    "- a list whether sorted or not, will require $\\Theta(n)$ time for either insertion or removal\n",
    "- BST would require $\\Theta(nlogn)$ time in the average case; however BST can become unbalanced leading to bad performance $O(n^2)$\n",
    "- Heap data structrue is an efficient way!\n",

    "## Heap\n",
    "- **heap** data structure is used to represent priority queues\n",
    "- heap is also the name for a memory segment (**free store**)\n",
    "- two properties:\n",
    "    1. it is a complete binary tree\n",
    "        - heaps are nearly always implemented using the array representation\n",
    "    2. the values stored in a heap data structure are partially ordered\n",
    "        - there's a relationship between the value stored at any node and the values of its children\n",
    "        - no relationship between the siblings (unlike BST)\n",
    "- two types of heap:\n",
    "    1. max heap\n",
    "        - every node stores a value that is **greater** than or equal to the value of either of its children\n",
    "        - by its definition, root stores the maximum of all values in the tree\n",
    "    2. min heap\n",
    "        - every node stores a value that is **less** than or equal to that of its children\n",
    "        - by its definition, root stores the minimum of all values in the tree\n",
    "- Heapsort uses max heap\n",
    "- Replacement Selection algorithm used for external sorting uses min heap"
