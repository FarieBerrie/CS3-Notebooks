    "- most flexible and important data structure\n",
    "- consists of a set of nodes (vertices), and a set of edges \n",
    "    - each edge connects two nodes\n",
    "- trees and lists can be be viewed as special cases of graphs\n",

    "## Graphs Vs Trees\n",
    "- https://freefeast.info/difference-between/difference-between-trees-and-graphs-trees-vs-graphs/\n",
    "- Tree is a restricted form of graph which is minimally connected having only one path between any two vertices\n",
    "- Trees have direction (parent/child relationships) without cycles (Directed Acyclic Graph, DAG)\n",
    "    - a child can have only one parent\n",
    "- Graphs can have more than one edges connecting vertices\n",
    "    - more than one path\n",
    "    - can have uni-directional or bi-directional paths (edges) between nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "## Applications\n",
    "- used to model both real-world systems and abstract problems, e.g.:\n",
    "- modeling connectivity in computer networks\n",
    "- representing maps as a set of locations with distances between locations (GPS shortest route finder)\n",
    "- modeling flow capacities in transportation networks (finding bottlenecks)\n",
    "- modeling a path from a starting condition to a goal condition (used in AI and video games)\n",
    "- modeling relationships such as family trees, social networks, scientific taxonomies\n",
    "\n",
    "## Terminologies\n",
    "- **graph** $G = (V, E)$ consists of a set of **vertices** $V$ and a set of **edges** $E$\n",
    "    - each edge in $E$ is a connection between a pair of vertices in $V$\n",
    "- $\\|V\\|$ - number of vertices\n",
    "- $\\|E\\|$ - the number of edges \n",
    "    - $\\|E\\|$ can range from zero to a maximum of $\\|V^2\\| - \\|V\\|$\n",
    "- **adjacent** vertices with a direct connection is written $(a, b)$\n",
    "    - $a$ is adjacent to $b$ and vice-versa\n",
    "- **path** - sequence of vertices $v_1, v_2, ..., v_n$ with length $n-1$ if there's path from $v_1$ to $v_n$\n",
    "- **simple path** - all vertices on its path are unique\n",
    "- **length** of a path is the number of edges it contains\n",
    "- **cycle** is a path of length three or more that connects some vertex $v_i$ to itself\n",
    "- **simple cycle** - simple path except that the first and last vertices are the same\n",
