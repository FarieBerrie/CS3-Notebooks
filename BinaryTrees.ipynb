    "- **Tree DS** structures in general enable efficient access and efficient update to large collections of data\n",
    "- look like upside-down real-world trees\n",
    "\n",
    "### Some serious advantages of Tree DS\n",
    "- reflect structural relationship in the data\n",
    "- represent hierarchies\n",
    "- provide an efficient insertion and searching\n",

    "## Binary Trees\n",
    "- **Binary Trees** in particular are widely used for many things besides searching\n",
    "    - prioritizing jobs, describing mathematical expressions, examining syntactic elements of computer programs, organizing information needed to drive data compression algorithms \n",
    "- Binary Trees are made of a finite set of elements called **nodes**\n",
    "    - nodes are represented as a box or a circle as shown in the following figures\n",
    "    - each node typically contains data and two pointers pointing to left and right children\n",
    "    - Binary Tree can be either empty or consists of a special node called the **root** node with at most two binary subtrees, called the **left subtree** and **right subtree**\n",
    "    - subtrees are disjoint (no nodes in common)\n",
    "    - there's an edge (path) from a node (**parent**) to each of its **children**\n",
    "    - **Path**: the sequence of nodes from a node to the destination node, e.g., $5->3->1$ is the path from node $5$ to node $1$ in the following figure 2.\n",
    "    - **length of the path** is the no. of edges in the path; if there are $n$ nodes in the path, length is $n - 1$\n",
    "        - e.g., length of path in $5 ->3 ->1$ is $2$\n",
    "    - if there's a path from $A$ to $B$, $A$ is the **ancestor** of $B$ and $B$ is a **descendant** of $A$\n",
    "        - all nodes in the tree are descendants of the root of the tree\n",
    "        - root is the ancestor of the nodes\n",
    "    - **depth** of a node $M$ in the tree is the length of the path (# of edges) from the root of the tree to $M$\n",
    "    - **leaf node** is the node that doesn't have any children \n",
    "    - **height** of a tree is the depth of the deepest node in the tree\n",
    "        - longest path from root to one of the **leaf nodes**\n",
    "    - the root is at **level** $0$\n",
    "        - all nodes of depth $d$ are at **level** $d$ in the tree\n",
