    "- collisions occurs when two records hash to the same slot/index in the table\n",
    "- E.g. Birthday Paradox: If there are 23 students in a class, there's 50% probability that two will share a birthday\n",
    "    - even though there are 365 days; 100% when there are 367\n",
    "- **HT** collusion depends on the distribution of the keys which we typically do not have control over\n",
    "- generally, pick a hash function that maps keys to slots in a way that makes each slot in the hash table have equal probability of being filled for the actual set keys being used"
